        <h2>HI, I&apos;m Anurag Uranw. Nice to meet you.</h2>
        <p>My interest in technology began when i saw a computer for the first time, and getting my first laptop in college ignited my passion for coding. To pursue this path, web development was the most accessible route to achieve my goals. While exploring web development, I was particularly charmed by the potential of frontend to create interactive and user-friendly experiences. Now, I&apos;m dedicated to expanding my frontend skillset and embarking on a fulfilling journey in this ever-evolving field.</p>
